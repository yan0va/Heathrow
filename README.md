##Makers Academy Week 3 Test


###Aim

The aim of this test was to write software to control the flow of planes at an airport.

We had to create separate files for every class, module and test suite. 


Features

* Planes can land and take off, given the weather is sunny
* The weather is controlled by a random number generator, and is ocasionally stormy 
* Every plane must have a status indicating whether it is flying or landed
* Once all the planes are in the air, check that they have the status of flying!
* Check when all the planes have landed that they have the right status "landed"
* Add messages to explain what is going on, e.g "Sorry! You can't take off due to stormy weather"
